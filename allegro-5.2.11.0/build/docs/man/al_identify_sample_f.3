.EX
#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro_audio.h>\f[R]

char const *al_identify_sample_f(ALLEGRO_FILE *fp)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Tries to guess the audio file type of the open ALLEGRO_FILE by reading
the first few bytes.
By default Allegro cannot recognize any file types, but calling
al_init_acodec_addon(3) will add detection of the types it can read.
You can also use al_register_sample_identifier(3) to add identification
for custom file types.
.PP
Returns a pointer to a static string with a file extension for the type,
including the leading dot.
For example \[lq].wav\[rq] or \[lq].ogg\[rq].
Returns NULL if the audio type cannot be determined.
