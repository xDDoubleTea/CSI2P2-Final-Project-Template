.SH DESCRIPTION
Loads and plays an audio file, streaming from disk as it is needed.
This API can only play one audio stream at a time.
This requires a default mixer to be set, which is typically done via
al_reserve_samples(3), but can also be done via al_set_default_mixer(3).
.PP
Returns the stream on success, NULL on failure.
You must not destroy the returned stream, it will be automatically
destroyed when the addon is shut down.

.PP
\f[I]Note:\f[R] the allegro_audio library does not support any audio
file formats by default.
You must use the allegro_acodec addon, or register your own format
handler.
