The display may be NULL, otherwise the given display is treated as the

want to spawn a thread with al_create_thread(3) and call it from inside
that thread.
.PP
Returns true on success, false on failure.
.RS
.PP
\f[I]Note:\f[R] On Android, ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_HALT_DRAWING(3) and
ALLEGRO_EVENT_DISPLAY_RESUME_DRAWING(3) need to be handled before this
function returns.
This means that you must call it from a different thread.
