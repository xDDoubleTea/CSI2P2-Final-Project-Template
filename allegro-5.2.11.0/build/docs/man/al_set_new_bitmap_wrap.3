#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro.h>\f[R]

void al_set_new_bitmap_wrap(ALLEGRO_BITMAP_WRAP u, ALLEGRO_BITMAP_WRAP v)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Sets the texture wrapping settings for newly created bitmaps (on the
current thread).
Typically you take advantage of this feature either via the primitives
addon (see al_draw_prim(3) and others) or via custom shaders (see
ALLEGRO_SHADER(3)).

.PP
\f[I]Note:\f[R] In the context of custom shaders, Direct3D and OpenGL
have different granularities for controlling this setting.
Direct3D sets wrapping setting for each sampler separately, while OpenGL
sets it per\-texture.
This interacts particularly poorly with the primitives addon which (for
backwards compatibility) alters the wrapping setting.
To minimize this issue, use a wrapping setting that\[cq]s not
ALLEGRO_BITMAP_WRAP_DEFAULT.
