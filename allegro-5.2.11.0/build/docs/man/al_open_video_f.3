#include \f[B]<allegro5/allegro_video.h>\f[R]

ALLEGRO_VIDEO* al_open_video_f(ALLEGRO_FILE *fp, const char *ident)
.EE
.SH DESCRIPTION
Opens a video file from an existing \f[CR]ALLEGRO_FILE*\f[R] using the
Allegro file interface system.
This allows videos to be loaded from custom sources such as memory
streams, virtual file systems, archives, or any other source supported
by a custom \f[CR]ALLEGRO_FILE_INTERFACE\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]Parameters:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CR]file\f[R]: A pointer to an \f[CR]ALLEGRO_FILE\f[R] object.
Ownership of this file is transferred to the video object; the file will
be closed automatically when \f[CR]al_close_video\f[R] is called.
.PP
\f[B]Returns:\f[R] A pointer to a new \f[CR]ALLEGRO_VIDEO\f[R] object if
successful, or \f[CR]NULL\f[R] on failure.
.PP
\f[B]Remarks:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
The function does \f[B]not\f[R] require the file to be seeked or
rewound; it reads from the current position.
.IP \[bu] 2
After calling \f[CR]al_open_video_f\f[R], you must not manually close
the \f[CR]ALLEGRO_FILE\f[R]; call \f[CR]al_close_video\f[R] to free all
associated resources.
.IP \[bu] 2
This function mirrors the behavior of other \f[CR]_f\f[R] variants in
the Allegro API, enabling video streaming from custom file systems.
.PP
\f[B]Example:\f[R]
.IP
.EX
ALLEGRO_FILE *f = al_fopen(\[dq]video.ogv\[dq], \[dq]rb\[dq]);
\f[B]if\f[R] (f) {
    ALLEGRO_VIDEO *vid = al_open_video_f(f);
    \f[B]if\f[R] (vid) {
        float fps = al_get_video_fps(vid);
        \f[I]// ... use the video ...\f[R]
        al_close_video(vid); \f[I]// also closes f\f[R]
    }
